# SPI-Neopixel
Circuit to convert 800kHz SPI bus mode 1 into WS2812 "Neopixel" pulse width data

/CS (chip select active low) allows you to have other things on the same SPI bus as this converter.

Tested in breadboard form to be working. Ordered PCB's using this board file from OSHpark. Will update when that has been tested.
